I am going yo support our groups’ signal parts. But in every part of the project we will help us.
Our idea is smart parking system.
The sensors willlet us know if the parking system is full or not. We will save the information of all cars which come there and park for 8 times.
We will give the 9th parking, 1 free parking choice. We will do it by creating database.
